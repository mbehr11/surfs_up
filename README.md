## Overview of SurfsUP_Analysis:

After vacationing in Hawaii, you decided you want to open a surf and ice-cream shop. After meeting with W.Avy he will back your business plan, but he needs a weather analysis. From the plot chart he can see the top months for precipitation. By then showing the statistical model he can see the count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max. You even were able to show him the top station for weather. Now w.Avy wants to do a more in-depth analysis on the temperature data for June and December in Oahu. Overall he wants to make sure this business will be prosperous all year round.
